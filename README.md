# SwiftUI Issues, Limitations & Unknowns
With Apple's documentation for SwiftUI being limited, I wanted to create a central resource of all bugs, issues and limitations with SwiftUI.

## Current Issues
- Environment/observed objects lose data on list view change. This problem appear in case when parent view updated with same data in terms of hash. The bug is not appearing when the parent view updated with different data.
